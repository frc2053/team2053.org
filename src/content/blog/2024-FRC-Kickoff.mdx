STR has started designing and building our robot for the 2024 season, Cresendo. This seasons alliances have to pick up and score "notes" into an "amp" or "speaker". When enough notes are scored into the amp, the human player can choose to amplify their alliances speaker or to activate their amp and cooperate with enemy alliance for a cooperation point. At the end of the match robots can hang at a "stand" and have a chance to score another note into a "trap" for extra points.
