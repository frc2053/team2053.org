At NY Tech Valley Robot Rumble, Ballston Springs NY (near Albany), the weekend of November 2nd, we were seeded 4th at the end of the qualification matches and were the 1st pick of the 1st seeded alliance. 

We made it all the way to the finals where we were defeated by the 3rd seed alliance. 


We also took the quality award for our robot! This is the best our team has done! We are all super proud of the results.
