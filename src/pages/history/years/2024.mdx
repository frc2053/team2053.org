## Game Information

The 2024 FIRST® Robotics Competition game is called Crescendo. It’s a music-themed game where two alliances of three teams each compete to score points by performing various tasks. The core tasks include shooting foam rings called "Notes" into designated goals, amplifying a "Speaker" for bonus points, and cooperating with the opposing alliance for additional rewards. In the final phase of the game, robots rush to hang on chains for additional points, with bonuses for harmonizing on the same chain. The alliance that scores the most points, combining tasks and cooperation, wins the match​
