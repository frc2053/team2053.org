## Game Information

Reefscape is the FIRST Robotics Competition game for the 2025 season. The game is themed around exploring a coral reef as part of the FIRST-wide FIRST Dive season, which focuses on ocean exploration and conservation. Two alliances of three robots each work to score PVC pipes (called Coral) and playground balls (called Algae) into goals. At the end of the match, robots move to a truss structure called the Barge and climb metal Cages to earn additional points.
