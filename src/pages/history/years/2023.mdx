## Game Information

FIRST CHARGED UP was the 2023 FIRST Robotics Competition game. CHARGED UP is played by two alliances of three teams each, with each team controlling a robot and completing specific actions in order to score points. The game revolves around both alliances filling each team's grid with cones and cubes, as well as scoring links to score bonus points. Each robot also could balance on the Charge Station with teammates to get Ranking Points.
