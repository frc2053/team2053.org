## Image Best Practices

### Before Uploading
- Use descriptive file names (e.g., `robot-at-competition.jpg` not `IMG_1234.jpg`)
- Take photos in landscape orientation when possible
- Ensure good lighting and clear subjects

### File Sizes
Don't worry too much about file sizes - the CMS automatically:
- Resizes images larger than 1920px
- Compresses images to 85% quality
- Converts to WebP format (25-35% smaller than JPEG)

### Recommended Sizes
- **Featured Images**: 1200x800px or larger
- **In-content images**: 800px wide minimum
- **Logos**: 200-400px wide

## Tips for Writing Great Content

### Blog Posts
- Start with an engaging opening paragraph
- Use headers (##, ###) to break up long posts
- Include lots of photos - visual content is engaging!
- Add specific details (dates, locations, team member names)
- Proofread before publishing

### History Pages
- Focus on what made that year unique
- Include robot specifications and capabilities
- Mention key moments from competitions
- Credit team members who contributed significantly
- Add photos showing the robot in action

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to repository"
- Make sure you're logged in with the correct account
- Contact a mentor - Git Gateway may need to be re-enabled

### Images not uploading
- Check file size (keep under 10MB before upload)
- Ensure file is a supported format (JPG, PNG, WEBP, GIF)
- Try a different browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended)

### Changes not appearing on live site
- Changes take 2-3 minutes to deploy
- Check Netlify deploy status (mentors can help)
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Accidentally deleted something
- Contact a mentor immediately
- All changes are tracked in Git - we can restore anything!
