During the break the mentors discussed how to approach the upcoming 2025 season.  The mentors decided to build a different robot for the same 2024 FRC Crescendo game play.  With the permission of team FRC 9496 LYNK we started with their robot concept design.  Over the summer CAD models were developed and when the Fall semester started we proceeded with building the robot. \n\nThere were several goals we wanted to accomplish with this build. For the returning students and mentors this was a means to keep their skills sharp.  For the new students and mentor that joined this Fall they will became familiar with how the team works and participate in the construction.  The new students and mentor can see and experience multiple activities (manufacture, electrical, programming, etc.) and see what areas they are most interested in.  We also have the successful first use of the new HAAS CNC machines to manufacture robot components.  These new components will provide greater strength and rigidity of the robot base. \n\nSo that the new build had specific competition goals the Team entered two competitions scheduled for October and November 2024.  The first is the Ra Cha Cha Ruckus in Rochester on October 26th and the New York Tech Valley Robot Rumble on November 2nd.\n\nFrom September through October the Team has been hard at work building a robot to compete at the Fall 2024 off-season competitions. The two competitions are the Ra Cha Cha Ruckus in Rochester on October 26th and the New York Tech Valley Robot Rumble on November 2nd. The robot is based on the design of FRC 9496 LYNK (with their permission) for the 2024 Crescendo FRC competition. The robot build is a warm-up for the coming 2025 competition season. There are several goals we wanted to accomplish during this build. For the students and mentors returning from the 2024 FRC competition we want to keep their skills sharp. The new student and mentor team members that joined this Fall are to become familiar with how the team works and participate in the construction. The new students and mentor can see and experience multiple activities (manufacture, electrical, programming, etc.) and see what areas they are most interested in. We also have the successful first use of the new HAAS CNC machines to manufacture robot components. These new components will provide greater strength and rigidity of the robot base. \n\nNew students being introduced to creating Computer Aided Designs (CAD) drawings that are the basis for creating parts for the robot.  We use the Onshape CAD software system that is the standard for the high school.  During the competition season it is critical that drawings of parts be done quickly and accurately to support prototyping and ultimately the final manufacturing and testing of the final robot design.\n![New students learning CAD](/assets/images/CADing.webp)\n\n\nSoldering is a skill that looks simple but there are subtleties involved in getting reliable and clean solder joints.  A Mentor is teaching a new student how to solder.  With the bashing and collisions that the robots will experience during competition having solid joints is critical to finishing all the matches.\n![Soldering lesson](/assets/images/20240927_183829.webp)\n\nThe students are assembling a rotating shaft that is used for the intake on the robot of the soft rings shot at the targets.  This is one of many sub-assemblies that will be integrated onto the robot chassis.\n![Partial intake assembly](/assets/images/20240927_183750.webp)\n\nWe have the use of a large classroom with tables, chairs, and computers that are shown in the previous photos.  Adjacent to the classroom is a work shop with machines, tools, and workbenches to work with wood and metal.  In addition to the standard wood and metal working machines we purchased and installed two Haas router and lathe machines.  They are on the left side of the picture.\n![Wide view of shop](/assets/images/20241004_175227.webp)\n\nThe students are building the bumper that attaches to the base of the robot.  A wooden structure is built that attaches to the robot frame.  On the wooden structure plastic noodles (the kind used in swimming pools) are attached to the wooden structure that provides shock absorption.  The bumpers are then covered in a very strong tear resistant fabric.  The robots weigh up to 125 lbs and can travel up to 13 mph.  In a match there are six robots on the field crashing into each other as they whiz around attempting to score points.  The bumpers absorb the impacts and minimize the shocks that can cause significant damage.\n![Constructing bumper frame](/assets/images/20241007_175040.webp)\n\nThe CNC routing machine is being set up to make parts for the robot.  This will be the first production part made that will be used in the competition robot.\n![Setting up the router](/assets/images/20240930_193712.webp)\n\nThe router turned this chunk of metal …\n![Raw stock](/assets/images/20240930_193640.webp)\n\n… into this finished part.\n![Finished part](/assets/images/20240930_193547.webp)\n\nThe students are assembling the base of the robot.  The base houses the computer, electronics, the motors that drive the robot, and the wiring the ties it all together.  The wheels on the front are part of the ring intake mechanism.  The robot drives to the ring and the intake mechanism sucks up the ring to the shooter (which is yet to be attached).\n![Base assembly](/assets/images/20241004_174955.webp)\n\nWith the robot base and intake mechanism assembled we began testing  the intake mechanism.  The robot drives up to flexible orange rings on the floor and the intake mechanism loads the ring into the shooting mechanism (not yet installed).\n![Intake test](/assets/images/20240927_194018.webp)\n\nIn this photo the Team is installing the shooting mechanism (shooter) and wiring up the motors to the electronics that controls the speed of the multiple motors that make up the shooter.\n![Shooter assembly](/assets/images/20241004_180328.webp)\n\nThe students are doing the adjustments to the completed assembly of the robot.  Here the students are making adjustments to the intake mechanism that feeds the shooting mechanism.\n![Intake adjustments](/assets/images/20241009_174915.webp)\n\nHere is the complete robot.  The intake mechanism at the front of the robot rolls over to flexible rings on the floor.  The rotating shaft sucks up and loads the ring into the shooting mechanism which is the flat black plate.\n![Robot shooter view](/assets/images/20241120_192423.webp)\n\nThe view of the other side of the robot.  You can see some of the electronics and wiring that is underneath the shooting mechanism.  The grey box is the battery.  The triangular mechanisms at the corner of the base are swerve drives that contain the robot wheels that can drive the robot up to 13 mph and quickly rotate to maneuver around the competition field.\n![Robot electronics view](/assets/images/20241120_192452v2.webp)\n\nDuring a match the robot is required to perform three main tasks during to score points.  The robot has to shoot a ring into a “Speaker”, deliver a ring to an “Amp”, and climb onto a “Stage”.  \n\nThe robot is shooting a ring into a mockup of the Speaker that is the target.  The orange ring flies into the gap near the top of the Speaker to score points.  The speed and angle of the ring as it flies to the speaker is controlled by varying the speed of a pair of rollers that propel the ring to the Speaker.\n![Speaker shooting test](/assets/images/Test2024Speaker.webp)\n\nThe students are making more adjustments to the robot prior to testing the robot at the Amplifier target.\n![Amplifier shooting test adjustment](/assets/images/20241018_183741.webp)\n\nThe robot gently shoots the orange ring so that it falls into gap in the Amplifier target.\n![Speaker shooting test](/assets/images/Test2024Amplifier.webp)\n\nThe robot is now ready for the Rochester and Albany competitions!","src/content/blog/2024-OffSeason-Build.mdx","78512f98720bab12","2024-OffSeason-Build.mdx","2024-offseason-competition",{"id":75,"data":77,"body":86,"filePath":87,"digest":88,"legacyId":89,"deferredRender":29},{"title":64,"description":78,"publishDate":79,"featuredImage":80,"excerpt":81,"tags":82},"Off-Season Competition at Rochester and Albany",["Date","2024-12-15T00:00:00.000Z"],"/assets/images/Awards.webp","Off-Season Competition",[54,40,83,84,85,56],"Off-season Competition","‘Rochester’","‘Albany’","The Team finished our robot just in time to compete in two off-season events. The first was the Rah Cha Cha Ruckus Rochester NY, over the weekend of Oct 26th, and the other the NY Tech Valley Robot Rumble Ballston Springs NY (near Albany), the weekend of November 2nd. \n\nThe Rochester event was a shake down of our newly built robot.  We encountered several problems and completed the qualifying rounds with 4 wins and 6 losses.  However, for the playoffs we were picked 1st by the 5th seeded alliance. We ended up making it to round 4 of the playoffs, placing us in 5th place overall at the end of the tournament. Here is a link to a video of our robot playing (we’re blue #2053): \n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eq4JNl4NrF4\">FRC Rah Cha Cha Ruckus Video\u003C/a>\n![field](/assets/images/Rochestervideo.webp)\n\nAt the Albany event we performed much better given the experience we had at Rochester.  We were seeded 4th at the end of the qualification matches and were the 1st pick of the 1st seeded alliance. We made it all the way to the finals where we were defeated by the 3rd seed alliance. We also were awarded the quality award for our robot! This is the best our team has done! We are all super proud of the results.

Here is a montage of photos from the Rochester and Albany competitions.\n\nThe Team attending the NY Tech Valley Robot Rumble Ballston Springs NY (near Albany) on November 2nd.\n![At NY Tech Valley Robot Rumble](/assets/images/Team2053.webp)\n\nThe playing field is approximately 27 by 54 feet.  To provide scale an NBA basketball court is 50 by 94 feet.  Each team plays multiple matches to determine seeding for the playoffs.  Each match has two alliances, a red alliance and a blue alliance, composed of three teams.  In each match the team makeup of an alliance changes so in one match you are in alliance with a team and in another match you are competing against the same team.  Each match is 2 minutes 30 seconds long.  Each team typically plays 8 to 10 qualification matches to determine seeding in the playoff matches.\n![Playing field](/assets/images/PlayingField.webp)\n\nFor each match a team of 4 students and a mentor setup and operate the robot.  One student helps move and setup the robot. One student feeds the rings to the robot during match play.  Two students operate the robot (a driver and a shooter) and a mentor is the coach during the match play.  \n![Match Team](/assets/images/20241026_084406.webp)\n\nDuring the matches the robot takes a beating as there are six robots on the field at the same time.  A robot can weigh up to 125 lbs and travel at a speed up to 13 mph.  There are a lot of inadvertent, as well as deliberate, collisions that test the robustness of the robot.  In addition, adjustments are made to the mechanical, electrical, and software of the robot based on performance in a match.  The Pit Crew is responsible for making repairs and adjustments during the competition.  The time between matches can be as little as ½ hour so the Pit Crew must be ready and able to diagnose and make repairs and adjustments quickly.\n![Pit Team](/assets/images/PitTeam.webp)\n\nAn important tenant of FIRST® Robotics Competition (FRC) is “coopertition”, a portmanteau of cooperation and competition.  Teams are encouraged to help and cooperate with each other, sharing knowledge and resources, while still striving to win.  For each match an alliance is formed from three teams.  Here the three teams are discussing a strategy that uses the strengths of each of the teams to win the match.  In subsequent matches the teams may be on opposite alliances.\n![Alliance meeting](/assets/images/20241026_095746.webp)\n\nWe are at the operator’s station ready and waiting for the match to start.\n![Waiting for match to start](/assets/images/IMG_2449.webp)\n\nOur robot, 2053, is on the field.

Although our alliance was defeated in the final it was the best finish our team has had so far since Southern Tier Robotics was started in 2022.\n![Alliance Team](/assets/images/AllianceTeam.webp)\n\nAt the NY Tech Valley Rumble we received two awards.  The first was being a finalist in the competition.  The second was the Quality Award.

A worksheet was created with questions about the game.  The worksheet made references to the videos and the official rule book which is 160 pages long!  The worksheet is created to help  the Team members engage in detail with the material so they become intimately familiar with the game play and rules.\n\n![Working in groups](/assets/images/20250104_132202.webp)\n\n\n![Working in groups](/assets/images/20250104_131959.webp)\n\n\n![Working in groups](/assets/images/20250104_132457.webp)\n\nAfter the group work period we all gathered into the conference room to discuss the game play and rules.  The discussion allowed everyone to start understanding the finer points of the game such as how the various scoring modes affect the strategy for the robot. \n\n![Team discussions](/assets/images/20250104_150719.webp)\n\nWe then moved to performing the “human simulation” of the game.  We taped off ½ of the game field with the locations of the game piece distribution, robot start/end area, and scoring area.  Team members were selected to simulate the actions of the robot as we imagine they collect, move, and deposit the game pieces into the scoring area.  We ran the “human simulation” multiple times.  After each run we discussed how the actions and movements of the human robots affected the ability of the human robot to score.  \n\n![Human simulation](/assets/images/20250104_162812.webp)\n\nWith the completion of the “human simulation” we ended our kick-off activity.  We are now into an intensive 6 weeks of design/build/test to prepare for our first competition at the Hudson Valley Regional, March 5-8.  We are diving into more details about the nuances of the game, develop scoring strategies, and begin to develop concepts for the robot.  In parallel we’ll begin building mock-ups of the field elements that will be used for testing.\nOn a side note, one of our mentors was the head of the electrical team of the Binghamton University Rover Team: \n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.binghamton.edu/watson/competes/rover-team/index.html\">Binghamton University Rover Team | Thomas J.

The students are exposed to a very compressed lifecycle that many real world projects go through.  It gives them a chance to see the many different skills and disciplines that goes into making a competitive robot.  But this takes funds to buy the materials and components for the robot and travel costs to the competition.  Help the students participate in the robotic revolution!

The robot has to shoot a ring into a “Speaker”, deliver a ring to an “Amp”, and climb onto a “Stage”.  Here is a video developed by FRC that shows how the match unfolds and the robots score points during a match.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9keeDyFxzY4\">FRC Kickoff Game Video\u003C/a>\n![field](/assets/images/field.webp)\n\nOnce we had the initial design of Bruin in CAD we started to manufacture parts and perform initial assembly.  We meet in the  Vestal High School shop which consists of two large rooms. One room has tools and tables and an adjoining large classroom to do assembly and testing.\n\n![people in shop](/assets/images/shop.webp)\n\nThe table router is a key piece of equipment that is used to create wood, plastic, and metal components.  The table router is critical in cutting parts accurately in the volume needed.  The parts are designed in CAD and transferred to the table router computer which then cuts the parts out of the required material.\n\n![sam doing shit](/assets/images/router.webp)\n\nIn addition to building Bruin we also had to build the field elements which are the targets used for scoring.  Here we are building the field element called the Speaker used to test the performance of the robot’s shooter.  The specification for the Speaker is provided in the package of documentation for the competition.\n\n![speaker build](/assets/images/buildspeaker.webp)\n\nThe robot build is divided into several major components.  The base of the robot contains the battery, drive motors for the wheels, and a majority of the electronics.  Team members are starting the assembly of the base of the robot.\n\nThe frame that houses the battery, electronics, motors, and wheels must be strong to survive the banging and crashing during the competition matches.  \n\n![buildingframe-YIPPEE](/assets/images/buildingframe.webp)\n\nThe Team is wiring up the electronics, motors, and batteries housed within the frame.  All the components and wiring within the base must be strongly secured to withstand the banging and crashing in a match.  The robots can weigh up to 125 lbs and can travel approximately 19 ft/sec (13 mph).  During a match there are six robots whizzing round the field scooping up rings and shooting at the targets to score points.  The robots inevitably run into each other.\n\n![wires](/assets/images/wiring.webp)\n\n![morewires](/assets/images/morwires.webp)\n\nThe development of the Shooter that shoots rings into the Speaker started with developing a prototype and testing the performance by shooting into the Speaker field element.  Adjustments on the prototype shooter includes spacings of the motor mechanisms,angle of the shooter, and speed of the wheels that propel the ring into the Speaker.\n\n![shooterproto](/assets/images/protoshooter.webp)\n\nThe Team is determining how to position the Dunker on Bruin so that the ring is guided into the Amp opening.\n\n![dunkerpro](/assets/images/protodunker.webp)\n\nThe Team developed and tested the prototype for the ring Intake.  Rings are laying on the floor.  The Intake is underneath Bruin’s chassis.  Bruin maneuvers to capture and guide the ring up into the Shooter.\n\n![intakepro](/assets/images/protointake.webp)\n\n\nThe Team is assembling Bruin in the classroom portion of the shop. In the front of the picture the Team is doing the initial assembly of the shooter based on the prototype.

The CAD team had to update and refine the design quickly so new parts could be manufactured and installed.\n\n![some with cad](/assets/images/cadorsmth.webp)\n\nBruin is coming together nicely!\n\n![build](/assets/images/building.webp)\n\n![morbuild](/assets/images/builddddddd.webp)\n\nSoftware is the glue that ties all of electronics and hardware together.  Regular gaming controls are used to control the various capabilities of the robot including speed and direction control, ring Intake, controlling the Shooter and Dunker, and providing information to the Driver and Operator about the state of Bruin in the match.\n\nThe Team is mulling over the software to be developed and what the forward plan is.\n\n![drew being a nerd](/assets/images/software.webp)\n\nMultiple laptops are needed to develop and test the software.  One laptop is used to develop the software and the other laptop is used during operation of Bruin with the game controllers.\n\n![more software shit](/assets/images/softwaretest.webp)\n\nTesting the drive speed and direction software.\n\n![driving VROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM](/assets/images/drivetest.webp)\n\nBruin is complete and ready for testing!\n\n![robot hehehehehe](/assets/images/morbruin.webp)\n\nHere is a CAD representation of Bruin with the major components  identified.  The “Intake” picks up the rings that are on the floor and feeds it into the “Shooter”.  The Shooter fires the rings into the Speaker which scores points.  The “Dunker” is used when scoring points in the “Amp”.  The “Climber” is used at the end of the match.  The Climber extends upwards to latch onto a chain and then hauls itself up so that it is completely off the ground gaining additional points.  The “Drivebase” houses all the computer and electrical components and motors for the wheels.  Surrounding the Drivebase will be bumpers that protect the Drivebase from running into other robots.\n\nThis video is a CAD render of Bruin providing a 360 degree view.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRpmhJUepZg\">\"Bruin Render\"\u003C/a>\n\n![idfk](/assets/images/render.webp)\n\nWith the initial build of Bruin the Team proceeds to testing the complete robot.  Here the Team is testing the ability of the Shooter to shoot rings into the Speaker.\n\n\u003Ca href=\">htps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyR-_JTxVBA\">\"Auto Test\"\u003C/a>\n\n![shoot](/assets/images/shootertest.webp)\n\nAnother way to score points is for the Dunker to place a ring in the Amp. When a ring is obtained through the Intake it goes into the Shooter.  You can see the intake of the ring at the beginning of the video. The Dunker moves in front of the Shooter so that the ring is directed downwards into the Amp instead of shooting up into the Speaker.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/A33bDebZeqU\">\"Dunker Test\"\u003C/a>\n\n![dunker test](/assets/images/dunktest.webp)\n\nWe’re doing a test of the Climber.  Bruin will be driven under the chain and extend the Climber arms up and latch onto the chain.  Then the arms will ratch down which pulls Bruin up and off the ground.\n\n![kinky ass chain shit](/assets/images/chain.webp)\n\nDuring a match there will be six robots on the field.  There are two teams of 3 robots facing each other so the Bruin driver will have to contend with the opposing team trying to interfere with Bruin scoring.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTsttcKLZLU\">\"Full Robot Test\"\u003C/a>\n\n![full test](/assets/images/fulltest.webp)\n\nIn the next blog we’ll see what it’s like at the Pittsburgh and Albany regions competitions.","src/content/blog/Building-Bruin.mdx","8ed6452ebe2070c9","Building-Bruin.mdx","2025-reveal",{"id":119,"data":121,"body":129,"filePath":130,"digest":131,"legacyId":132,"deferredRender":29},{"title":122,"description":123,"publishDate":124,"featuredImage":125,"excerpt":126,"tags":127},"2025 Robot Reveal Rattlesnake","Meet Rattlesnake, STR's 2025 FIRST® Robotics Competition (FRC) robot.",["Date","2025-03-03T00:00:00.000Z"],"/assets/images/rattlesnakeback.webp","See yall at Hudson Valley and Tech Valley this year!",[128,22,23,99],"Reveal","import { YouTubeEmbedSection } from '@components/odyssey-theme';\n\n\nTeam 2053 is proud to present our Reefscape robot, Rattlesnake!\n\n- SDS Mk4i L2 Swerve\n- Custom elevator design loosely based on Thrifty Elevator Kit\n- 2 in 1 mechanism for handling coral and algae (the claw).

The disassembly was done with the utmost delicacy.\n![Robot disassembly](/assets/images/Picture1.webp)\n\nIn order to build a great robot we need to figure out what we want the robot to do and what are some of the critical parts to design first.  After everyone read the 2024 FIRST® Robotics Competition Game Manual we prioritized our goals for the season and started brainstorming ideas about how the robot could work.\n\n![Reading the manual](/assets/images/Picture2.webp)\n\nOver the past few weeks we have split into teams.\nWe have the Computer Aided Design (CAD) team creating electronic drawings to see how the parts fit together and how the parts need to be manufactured.

There were many activities including welcoming new students to the club, making repairs to Rattlesnake, preparing the shop, and preparing for and attending for the off-season competitions Ra Cha Cha Ruckus in Rochester NY on October and New York Tech Valley Robot Rumble at Ballston Spa NY in November.\n\nFRC released the 2025 Reefscape game on January 4th.  With the release our team immediately kicked-off the race to build a competitive robot.  We held our kick-off at the Binghamton University Fabrication Laboratory.\n ![Team discussion of game](/assets/images/20250104_150719.webp)\n\nAs part of the kick-off activities we held multiple mock game plays to better understand game nuances.\n \n![Human mock gaming](/assets/images/20250104_162812.webp)\n\n\n \nOnce we were back at the high school we continued to think about robot requirements, what strategies we should use to maximize scoring, and what the design should be for the various parts of the robot.  “Chalk talk” was a common activity amongst the students and mentors.\n ![Discussing design ideas](/assets/images/20250108_185711.webp)\n\nFor the design we used the CAD tool OnShape.  OnShape is taught in the technology class at the school so the students are familiar with it.  Here we are discussing an aspect of the design.  At the school we have the two work areas: classroom and workshop.  This discussion is held in the classroom area.  Computers, tables, and a large floor area are provided where groups can work on different aspects of the design and build components of the robot.\n\n![Discussing design ideas](/assets/images/20250115_171632.webp)\n\n \nAs parts of the design come into focus we begin creating prototypes to test our ideas.\n \n![Assembling a prototype](/assets/images/20250110_194823.webp)\n\n \n![Prototype testing](/assets/images/20250110_195423.webp)\nWhen the prototypes reveal that the ideas don’t work or we can see how the ideas can be improved we gather students and mentors together to discuss and evaluate ideas on how we should proceed.  \n \n![Discussing prototype improvements](/assets/images/20250122_192842.webp)\n\n \nAdjacent to the classroom we have a workshop that has our Haas mill and lathe, a tabletop router, spray paint booth, powered and hand woodworking tools, and benches.\n \n![Workshop manufacturing and assembling](/assets/images/20250127_174131.webp)\n\n \nStudent assembling a prototype for testing.\n \n![Assembling prototype](/assets/images/Prototyping.webp)\nStudent and mentor test the prototype.\n \n![Testing prototype](/assets/images/Prototyping-2.webp)\n\nWe built a field element that is used to load a game piece onto the robot.  Here we are testing a prototype of the robot mechanism that will accept the game piece.\n \n![Using a field element to test coral loader](/assets/images/20250124_192214.webp)\n\n \nAfter all the initial design, prototype building, and testing the design is deemed ready to begin manufacture and assembly to create the competition robot.\n\nThe Vestal School District purchased a Haas TM 2P Horizontal Mill and a Haas ST 10Y Lathe.  This is the first season where we made significant use of the machines to manufacture parts of the robot.  Two students are setting up the mill to begin to machine parts for the robot. \n \n![Manufacturing a component on the CNC mill](/assets/images/CNC-20240307_174815.webp)\n\n \nMentor teaching a student how to use the lathe.\n \n![Setting up the CNC lathe to manufacture a component](/assets/images/20250203_191739.webp)\n\n\nThis is a CAD of part of the elevator carriage that grabs and manipulates the game pieces “coral” and “algae” and some of the resulting manufactured parts.\n \n![CAD of assembled component of manipulator](/assets/images/CNC-20250131_180653.webp)\n\n \n![Component of manipulator](/assets/images/CNC-20250131_182413.webp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![Roller component](/assets/images/CNC-20250131_182306.webp)\n\nThis is a broad view of the classroom where discussions, CAD work, and some assembly is performed.

Student members visited several of the clubs to see efforts of the FLL students and to show what kinds of robots STR makes and competes.  In December 2024 STR students visited the Glenwood Elementary School FLL where they demonstrated their robot and we talked about Rattlesnake and how it competes.\n \n![Team members visit the Glenwood Elementary School FLL club](/assets/images/20241217_163557.webp)\n\n \n![FLL student showing how to program their robot](/assets/images/20241217_164607.webp)\n\n \n![Explaining an FRC match](/assets/images/20241217_160711.webp)\n\nIn March the Vestal Hills Elementary School FIRST® Lego League (FLL) club came to the high school to see how Rattlesnake is made and to see it in action.\n \n![Vestal Hills Elementary School students and parents](/assets/images/20250312_180233.webp)\n \nA mentor is explaining how Rattlesnake works to the elementary school students.\n \n![Showing how Rattlesnake works](/assets/images/20250312_173331.webp)\n\n \n![Showing how Rattlesnake works](/assets/images/20250312_173500.webp)\nRattlesnake demonstrates how it fetches algae from the reef and deposit it in the net on the barge in competition.\n \n![Demonstrating Rattlesnake with an alga](/assets/images/20250312_171911.webp)\nMentor and student showing how the Haas mill makes parts for Rattlesnake.

At the Kopernik Observatory & Science Center in Vestal, NY, the students gave a presentation and demonstration on the FIRST® Robotic Competition.\n \n![Presenting FRC and Rattlesnake](/assets/images/Kopernik-20250509_202235.webp)\n\n \n![Day in the life of Rattlesnake](/assets/images/20250509_202358.webp)\n\n \nThe FIRST® Lego League Expo was held in February at the SUNY Broome college.  We were invited to bring and demonstrate our robot.\n \n![At FLL at SUNY Broome College](/assets/images/FLL-Expo-Logo.webp)\n\n\n \nAlso at the Expo was the Binghamton University Athletic Robotics Club (ARC).  STR and ARC are establishing a relationship where ARC students are available to support STR students with additional projects.  The current project is the development of a “demobot”.  The demobot will be a simpler robot that can be easy to transport and operate.  The demobot will support presentations and demonstrations at schools, companies, and public events.  The development of the demobot will be a collaboration of STR and ARC students. \n![STR and BU ARC members](/assets/images/20250222_104152-cropped.webp)\n\n \nWe are demonstrating Rattlesnake operations to the parents and students of the FIRST® Lego League clubs.\n \n![Demonstrating Rattlesnake](/assets/images/FLL-Expo-Scoring.webp)\n\n \nFIRST®\nFor Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology\n \n![Future club members](/assets/images/FLL-IMG_0600.webp)","src/content/blog/Season-Summary-2025.mdx","129af0b2c7d1e6b6","Season-Summary-2025.mdx","we-moved",{"id":160,"data":162,"body":173,"filePath":174,"digest":175,"legacyId":176,"deferredRender":29},{"title":163,"description":164,"publishDate":165,"featuredImage":166,"excerpt":167,"tags":168},"We Moved!","Tigertronics moved and changed names.",["Date","2021-09-09T00:00:00.000Z"],"/assets/images/vestal-logo.webp","Tigertronics has moved from Union Endicott High School to Vestal High School.",[169,170,171,22,23,172],"Vestal","UE","Tigertronics","Union Endicott","Tigertronics has moved from Union Endicott High School to Vestal High School, just 10 minutes away from the old location!
